                <figcaption>An educator, curriculum writer, and  web developer with a background in mathematics, data analytics, and educational leadership.
                    Strong analytical reasoning and problem-solving skills, with a can-do attitude and openness to others' ideas. Highly self-motivated, 
                    efficient with superb attention to details, and strong communication skills. I am a graduate of Hampton University with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics. I earned a master’s degree in 
                    educational leadership from Seton Hall University. Prior to beginning my career in Full Stack Development, I 
                    served as a Math Instructional Coach where I led a team of fifteen teachers providing professional development in technology
                    and instructional best practices. Additionally, I led weekly data analysis of school-wide math data to school leadership, facilitated
                    professional learning communities, and served as the secondary testing coordinator. Other responsibilities included coaching and mentoring teachers,
                    maintaining data dashboards, serving on the district curriculum writing team, and delivering district-wide professional development.My experience in education has given me the ability to analyze and deconstruct complex issues, operate and thrive in high-stress work
                    environments, and collaborate with stakeholders across teams.My journey to Full Stack Development began with my passion for data analytics, which inspired me to learn SQL, Tableau, and 
                    Excel, and earn a certification in data analytics from General Assembly in Atlanta. The thrill of writing queries and 
                    manipulating data deepened my eagerness for data analysis and coding, which led me to enroll and complete the Georgia Tech 
                    Coding Boot Camp. When I'm not coding or attending a meetup, I love to fish, workout and travel. My favorite travel destination is 
                    Los Cabos. I love the scenery, marine life, and riding ATVs along the beach.  My dream vacation is a trip to Seychelles for marlin fishing.
